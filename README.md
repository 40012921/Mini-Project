# Mini-Project

Problem Statement:

Suppose a Hot-Dog requires three ingredients, Sausage, Bread and Mustard. There are three caterers. Each of them has only one ingredient with infinite supply. There is an Supplier who has infinite supply of all three ingredients. To make a hot-dog, the caterer has sausage (resp., bread and mustard) must have the other two ingredients bread and mustard (resp., sausage and mustard, and sausage and bread). The agent and caterers share a table. The supplier randomly generates two ingredients and notifies the caterer who needs these two ingredients. Once the ingredients are taken from the table, the Supplier supplies another two. On the other hand, each caterer waits for the supplier's notification. Once it is notified, the caterer picks up the ingredients, makes a hot-dog, eats for a while, and goes back to the table waiting for his next ingredients.
